# Quick and dirty progress bar for the Onion OLED display
#
# This allows you to visually display a progress bar on the bottom line
# of the Onion OLED display.  It's not the most efficient way to do this
# but works well enough.
#
# It expects a floating point number representing the progress, between 0 and 1.
#
# NB: 'oled-exp -i' should be called *before* using this script.
#
# Example:
#   progress .5
#  will show
#   [==========         ]
#  on the bottom line of the OLED display.
#
# BUGS
#    No boundary or type checking is performed, so passing in no input,
#    numbers less than 0 or greater than 1, strings, etc. is not handled.
