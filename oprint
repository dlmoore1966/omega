# Print to the Onion OLED display, preserving newlines
#
# This allows piping data to the OLED display while preserving more complex
# formatting.  It can be used in a pipe as it reads from stdin and then wraps
# the data in the oled-exp format.
#
# NB: 'oled-exp -i' should be called *before* using this script.
#
# Example:
#   ls -1 | ./oprint

oled-exp -c write "`awk -vRS="\n" -vORS="\\\\\n" '1' $*`"
